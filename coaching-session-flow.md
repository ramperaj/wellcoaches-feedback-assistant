## ENGAGE
**Purpose:** Establish presence, positive affect, and psychological safety; start with strengths.

**Key criteria**
- Presence check-in / warm start
- Invite positives/what’s going well
- Judgment-free inquiry (open, curious, autonomy-supportive)
- Perceptive reflections & affirmations (values/strengths anchored)

**Exemplar phrasing (edit me)**
- *Presence / check-in:*  
  - “Before we dive in, how are you arriving today—anything you want me to know?”
- *Invite positives:*  
  - “What’s been going well since we last met—even small wins?”
- *Judgment-free inquiry:*  
  - “What feels most important to explore today?”
- *Perceptive reflection (values):*  
  - “I’m hearing that **consistency** matters because it supports your energy.”

## EXPERIMENT DISCOVERY REVIEW
**Purpose:** Review last experiment; surface learning; start positive; quantify success.

**Key criteria**
- Choose which experiment/result to review
- Explore full experience (start with what worked)
- Surface learning insights
- **Quantify success** (e.g., 0–10 or % + “what made it that number?”)
- Judgment-free inquiry; ongoing affirmations

**Exemplar phrasing (edit me)**
- *Start positive:*  
  - “What went better than expected in this experiment?”
- *Elicit learning:*  
  - “What did you learn about what helps you follow through?”
- *Quantify success:*  
  - “On a 0–10, where would you put this week’s success—and what made it a **6** rather than a **3**?”

---

## VISION REVIEW
**Purpose:** Reconnect with vision and medium-range goals to re-anchor motivation.

**Key criteria**
- Validate personal **vision** and **3-month goals**
- Evoke “best growth” experiences
- Inquiry + affirmations (values/strengths language)

**Exemplar phrasing (edit me)**
- “Which part of your vision feels most alive right now?”
- “What recent experience shows you you’re growing in the right direction?”

---

## GENERATIVE MOMENT
**Purpose:** Co-create today’s topic and expand options/resources.

**Key criteria**
- Co-select topic; clarify “what you really want from today”
- Identify internal/external resources
- Client-led brainstorming
- Judgment-free responses; affirmations
- **Permission-based expertise** when appropriate

**Exemplar phrasing (edit me)**
- *Topic set:*  
  - “If this conversation were a win for you, what would we leave with?”
- *Resource discovery:*  
  - “What strengths or supports could you bring into this?”
- *Permission ask before advice:*  
  - “Would it help if I shared a couple of ideas I’ve seen work—or would you prefer to brainstorm first?”

---

## EXPERIMENT DESIGN
**Purpose:** Move from idea to a specific, client-chosen experiment that builds self-efficacy.

**Key criteria**
- Client chooses the goal/experiment
- Confirm internal/external resources
- **Design specific goal** (when/where/how; smallest viable step; success criteria)
- Encourage self-efficacy; judgment-free inquiry; affirmations

**Exemplar phrasing (edit me)**
- *Specificity:*  
  - “What’s the **smallest version** you can do this week—when and where exactly?”
- *Success criteria:*  
  - “How will you know it was a success—what would a ‘7/10’ look like?”
- *Confidence check:*  
  - “On 0–10, how confident are you? What nudges it up one point?”

---

## DESTINY
**Purpose:** Consolidate learning and set up future success strategies.

**Key criteria**
- Articulate learning from this session
- Co-create strategies to sustain/scale success
- End with affirmation or next-step confidence

**Exemplar phrasing (edit me)**
- “What do you want to carry forward from today?”
- “What might help you protect time/energy for this next step?”

---

## OVERALL
**What great coaching sounded like in this session**
- Autonomy support; **permission before expertise**
- Presence markers: pausing, pacing, concise open questions
- Time management (topic set → explore → design → close)
- Language quality: reflections > advice; values/strengths visible

**Quick DO / DON’T (edit me)**
- **DO:** Ask open > advise; reflect values; invite quantification.  
- **DON’T:** Diagnose, judge, or give unsolicited advice.
