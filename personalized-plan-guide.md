# Personalized Improvement Plan — Guide

> How to generate a cohesive, **contextual** plan from a coaching transcript.
> Use **timestamps whenever available**; if none exist, use line ranges `Lxx–Lyy` or a 6–12-word quote.

## Principles

* **Personal, not generic:** address the student as **you**; use the client’s words.
* **Evidence-anchored:** cite **timestamps** on every evidence line if they exist.
* **One theme:** choose a clear throughline (e.g., *name values earlier*; *ask permission before expertise*; *quantify success before brainstorming*).
* **Smallest viable change:** design micro-skills that can be practiced within a week.
* **Measure what matters:** include a **baseline → target** for each micro-metric.

---

## Plan Structure

1. **Intro (4–6 sentences)** — name the theme, tie to 2–3 moments (timestamps + quotes), explain *why this matters for this client*.
2. **Next Session Focus (table)** — exactly 3 rows.
3. **Mini-Plans (3 paragraphs)** — one per micro-skill using **CAWEN**.
4. **Drills (3 items)** — mirror the mini-plans.
5. **Phrase Bank (3–5 lines)** — adapted to this client.
6. **Implementation Intentions (1–3)** — time-cued in the Flow.
7. **Micro-Metrics (3–4)** — baseline → target.
8. **Pre-Session Checklist (3–5)** — client-specific.
9. **Accountability & Stretch (2 lines)**.

## CAWEN Mini-Plan Pattern

**C — Context:** point to a precise moment (**timestamp + short quote**).
**A — Action:** the exact behavior you’ll use next time (no blanks).
**W — Why:** link to the client’s value/vision using their language.
**E — Evidence:** where it appeared this session (timestamps).
**N — Next-step metric:** **SMART** micro-metric (**baseline → target**).

**Example (values language first):**
“At **00:22:53**, you summarized the goal without naming the value (*‘Let’s aim for three walks’*). **Next time**, state the value first and then frame the SMART step (*‘Because **energy** is your why, you’ll walk 10 min after lunch M/W/F’*). This matters because the client said *‘I’m more consistent when I feel energized’*. **Evidence:** 00:22:53–00:23:12. **Metric:** values named in first 5 minutes (**baseline 0 → target ≥1**).”

**Example (permission before expertise):**
“At **00:14:07**, you offered tips without asking permission (*‘Try batching meals’*). **Next time**, ask first (*‘Would it help if I share two options?’*) and proceed only if the client agrees. This protects autonomy, which they named at 00:05:31 (*‘I need to choose my own pace’*). **Evidence:** 00:14:07–00:14:40. **Metric:** advice preceded by permission (**baseline 0% → target ≥90%**).”

**Example (quantify success):**
“At **00:31:18**, you reviewed outcomes but skipped a rating. **Next time**, elicit a **0–10** and one driver (*‘What made it a 6, not a 3?’*). This clarifies fit before brainstorming. **Evidence:** 00:30:55–00:31:40. **Metric:** sessions with explicit rating (**baseline No → target Yes**).”

---

## Drills: Patterns & Examples

**Pattern (2–3 sentences each):**

* Name the **exact lines/timestamps** to rewrite/rehearse.
* State **rehearsal dose** (e.g., rehearse aloud **3×**; record and self-rate).
* Define a **success cue** you will listen for in session.

**Example — Values Reflection Drill:**

* Rewrite your lines at **00:22:53–00:23:12** with values language; rehearse aloud **3×**; record once and self-rate clarity 0–10.
* **Success cue:** client echoes or expands the value unprompted.

**Example — Permission Ask Drill:**

* Draft **3** permission asks relevant to this client; rehearse **3×**; pair each with a fallback open question.
* **Success cue:** explicit yes/no before any advice.

**Example — Quantification Drill:**

* Practice **two** rating prompts and **one** follow-up driver question using the **00:31:18** moment as context.
* **Success cue:** rating + one driver secured before ideation.

---

## Contextual Phrase Bank

Use the client’s words; keep lines short and vivid.

* “It sounds like **consistency** matters because it supports your **energy**.”
* “Would it help if I share two options, or do you want to brainstorm first?”
* “On **0–10**, where would you put this week’s result—and what makes it a **6** rather than a **3**?”
* “What’s the **smallest version** that fits your week—when and where exactly?”
* “Hearing you say **family time** is the why, how shall we protect it in the plan?”

---

## Implementation Intentions

Tie to **when** they occur in the Flow.

* **If** the topic is set (≈ first 10 min), **then** ask for a success rating before brainstorming.
* **If** I notice I’m advising, **then** I’ll ask one open question first.
* **If** the goal sounds vague, **then** I’ll ground it with *when/where/how* and a confidence check.

---

## Micro-Metrics Menu

Choose 3–4; always set **baseline → target**.

* Advice preceded by permission (% of instances)
* Values explicitly named (count)
* Success quantification used (Y/N)
* Confidence scaling used (Y/N)
* Open questions before any idea (count or %)
* Client talk time (%)
* SMART goal clear on first attempt (Y/N)

---

## Pre-Session Checklist Examples

Keep it **client-specific**; reference obstacles by timestamp.

* Confirm topic in the first 5–10 min; capture the client’s words.
* Name at least one value before goal design.
* Timebox brainstorming; switch to goal design when a 0–10 rating is set.
* Ask permission before sharing any idea.
* Close by articulating learning + next tiny step.

---

## Accountability & Stretch

* **Tiny commitment:** e.g., post-session reflection within **10 minutes** using 3 prompts (Win / Learning / Next tweak).
* **Stretch behavior:** one concrete action just beyond comfort (e.g., *insert a values reflection before the first suggestion*).

---

## Anti-Vagueness Checks

Before finalizing, ensure each section:

* Names **specific moments** (**timestamps**) and **quotes** 6–12 words.
* States **one behavior** you will use next time (no placeholders).
* Includes **baseline → target** for each micro-metric.
* Reads as **paragraphs**, not fragments.

---

## Long Output & Chunking

When the plan is long, split into labeled parts and end each with:
**“Reply ‘more’ to continue the plan.”**
Suggested chunks: **Intro + Focus Table**, **Mini-Plans**, **Drills + Phrase Bank**, **Intentions + Metrics + Checklist + Accountability**.
